      "In today’s Finshots, we explain Tesla’s interest in India and the possible hurdles it might face.",
    des: `Last week, Elon Musk opened up about Tesla pulling into India during an X space. He said it’s a “natural progression” for Tesla to enter India, with the country now becoming the most populous nation in the world.

Seems like Musk wants to capitalise on India’s growing population.

It makes sense too. Tesla’s business has been slowing down in recent quarters.

The company’s annual car sales have dipped, and profits were down 40% in the December quarter compared to the previous year. The stock price has crashed 30% since the beginning of the year, leaving investors in a state of frenzy.

Clearly, entering new markets could help Tesla recharge its business.

But why did Tesla not enter the Indian markets before?

Well, one reason could be that the Indian government imposes a very high tax on foreign EV makers when they try to sell cars in India. Every time Tesla or any other EV maker brings a car to India for sale, they have to pay 70-100% of its cost to the Indian government.

This tax is called import duty.

The government has been justifying the high import duty, claiming that it is in place to protect the upcoming domestic EV players from disruption. However, foreign EV manufacturers have been lobbying the government to reconsider the taxes, saying their entry would give consumers more choices and make India’s EV ecosystem more robust and vibrant.

And it seems like the government has given in to their whims! It has recently announced a new EV policy that would lower import duties, which could make way for EV makers like Tesla in India.

Here is a breakdown of the new policy in broad terms–

EV makers would be allowed to sell up to 8,000 cars every year in India at 15% import duty if–

They invest a minimum of $500 million in India, which translates to a little over ₹4,150 crores
Set up a manufacturing facility in the country within three years from the time they start selling the cars, and
These factories locally source 25% of the components they use
Also, the price of the EV has to be higher than $35,000.

And this is actually a sweet spot for Tesla! Its most economical car, the Tesla Model 3, starts from $38,990.

Now, this cut in import duties might not be a coincidence. As we already said, Tesla has been lobbying for a lower import duty for the past four years. In return, it had promised to invest a huge amount in India.

And now that the policy is in place, the company seems to have started manufacturing for the Indian markets in its Berlin factory. These cars are just like the US models; the only difference is that they are right-hand-driven vehicles instead of left.

Tesla is also scouting locations to invest up to $3 billion in India to start its manufacturing factory. If its existing factories out of the US are any indication, it is expected that the company would make one big concentrated investment and open a Gigafactory, just like it did in Germany and China.

However, the question remains―Can cruising into India bring a screeching halt to Tesla’s business slowdown?

Maybe not.

Despite the vast population getting Elon Musk jumping for joy, India has lower-than-expected car sales.

In 2023, around 4.1 million cars were sold in India, out of which less than 2% were EVs. Compare this to China, a country with a similar population size, and you’ll see that around 30.1 million cars were sold in the country in 2023, out of which around 34% were EVs.

The lower EV penetration in India can be attributed to the dismal state of the charging infrastructure.

The charging infrastructure in India is scattered and lacks standardisation. Each EV maker has built its own network, but there is no interoperability.

For example, you might be unable to charge a Nissan car at a Tata charging station as their charger plug and voltage requirements differ.`,

      "In today’s Finshots, we tell you how and why powerful climate pollutant gases called HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) are being illegally traded across Europe.",
    des: `Imagine Andrei is a refrigerant trader in Romania. And he just managed to hoodwink the customs authorities at the border by passing off a climate-toxic HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) consignment as a more eco-friendly gas.

And it wasn’t even hard. All he had to do was mislabel the gas cylinder carrying the HFC as an HFO (hydrofluoroolefin) ― a gas marketed as a less toxic alternative to HFC because of its lower Global Warming Potential (GWP).

But Andrei isn’t the only one engaging in such illicit HFC trade. Many like him import more HFCs than they’re allowed to by underreporting the figures. Or even export less than they say they do while diverting the rest of the gas to countries within the EU (European Union).

Now, this kind of illegal HFC trade has a serious climate impact because HFCs are strong greenhouse gases. They can linger around in the atmosphere for nearly 15 years. And just 1 tonne of illegally traded HFC can have the same GWP as that of 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. For context, that’s the annual emission caused by driving 6.5 million petrol cars!

But why are HFCs being smuggled into the EU, you ask?

Well, you could blame it on something called an F-Gas Regulation.

Yes! A regulation that seems to have backfired.

In 2006, the EU rolled out this regulation to control emissions from F-gases or Fluorinated gases. These are man-made gases used in a range of industrial applications including air conditioning, refrigeration and heat pumps. But because they have a high GWP, the EU wanted to start phasing them out. So it started with preventing F-gas leaks from old fridges or ACs by introducing leak-check protocols.

But the ultimate goal was to reduce and completely abandon these toxic pollutants. And that’s exactly why the EU thought that it made sense to slowly give the Regulation a makeover.

A few years later, the revised Regulation aimed to cut down HFC use by 79% by 2030 from the yearly average HFC demand of about 182 million tonnes. And the EU could only do this if they’d targeted cutting down production and supply bit by bit every year. So they said “Hey, let’s introduce restrictions on HFC traders by introducing fixed quotas for each of them. That way they can’t produce or purchase more than the limits we impose on them.”

But it seems like things didn’t go as per the EU’s expectations. Because here’s the thing. Europe’s temperatures have been rising twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s according to the UN (United Nations). And if this continues, it simply means that air conditioner use could double in the continent by 2050 to cope with rising temperatures.

So naturally, HFCs will be in demand. But restrictions on their trade, thanks to the F-Gas Regulation, simply meant that supplies became scarce. And you know what happens when the demand for anything outdoes supply, right?

Prices rise.

In fact, HFC prices began rising in anticipation of an upcoming quota cutdown. Companies that needed these gases began hoarding them. The Environmental Investigation Report (EIA) that unearthed HFC smuggling even quotes that at one point in 2018, the price of a popularly used HFC-404A soared to 1,190% of its 2014 price.

In countries like Spain, higher taxes on HFCs with a higher GWP meant that prices of some of these gases even doubled because of heavy taxes.

Another reason why HFC prices skyrocketed was the quota allocation system.

See, the F-Gas Regulation allocates quotas to companies for free. But it only prefers large producers or major distributor companies that are three years or older. This means that big companies get nearly 90% of the HFC quotas, which makes it easy for them to monopolise trade and sell HFCs at steep prices.

And this simply paved the way for HFC smuggling in the EU. Smugglers sourced HFCs from China, the world’s biggest HFC producer and sneaked them in through EU border countries like Poland, Romania or Bulgaria where customs checks were weak or could be manipulated.

Getting caught was the last thing that worried them because the fines and penalties for violating the Regulation were too low in comparison to the profits they could pocket out of selling these gases in the black market.`,

    title: "How stock experts minted money from TV shows",
    des: `Zee Business is the number one ranked business channel in India as per data from the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC).

And guess the most popular shows?

Anything to do with the stock market, of course — ones such as 'First Trade' and '10 ki kamai'. Everyone wants to get a stock tip from the 'experts' who feature on the shows with the hope of making some quick bucks.

But looks like a few of these stock experts had ulterior motives when they made an appearance. They had a 'get rich quick' scheme in mind of their own. And the market regulator SEBI points out that some of them made close to ₹8 crores in profit in under a year!

So how did they do it, you ask?

In one word — front-running.

See, we told you some of Zee Business' most popular shows involved stock recommendations. These even included the BTST (Buy Today Sell Tomorrow) kind. Now these shows would invite a certain set of expert stock market guests. For instance, Kiran Jadhav and Ashish Kelkar who were also business partners, ran a show called Kiran Ka Kamal (Kiran’s Magic). Himanshu Gupta’s show was called Hitman Himanshu and Simi Bhaumik had a show called Simi Ke Non Stop Shares (Simi’s Non Stop Shares). And while Mudit Goyal was not even a SEBI-registered Research Analyst, he recommended stocks on a show called Mudit Ke Munafe (Mudit’s Profits).

And maybe their TV influence planted an evil idea in the head of Nirmal Soni, the mastermind behind the whole fraudulent scheme. He's someone who initially worked with a stock broker and then struck out on his own. Maybe his experience helped him build connections in the industry too. And soon, he may have been encouraged to approach guests whose stock shows were a buzz on Zee Business.

His scheme was simple. He’d take stock recommendations from these guest experts a few minutes before they’d appear on TV. Then he’d pass this information to his network in a couple of stockbroking entities.

So if a guest expert told Nirmal that they’d be recommending viewers to buy a certain stock, his network would go ahead and lap up those shares before the guest went on air. The stock recommendation would influence the public to invest in them immediately. And that would increase trading volumes and in turn, increase stock prices too. As soon as that happened, Nirmal’s associates would sell the stock and pocket a cool profit.

And if you’re wondering how much influence these TV guests had on the stock market, here are a couple of mind-blowing figures that SEBI highlighted in its interim order.`,

      "Sunny Side Up 🍳: Ola, Uber’s new plan, Tata Neu’s food delivery experiment and exercising",
    des: `Hey folks!

The world’s first jet charter company specifically designed for dogs is here.

BARK, a popular dog toy company, plans to take off BARK Air ― a new airline, exclusively for dogs and their humans in the US.

And they have a good reason to bet big on pet travel. Flying your furry friends in the cargo carriage of commercial flights can be scary since dogs are often flown to wrong destinations or mishandled at airports. So BARK thinks that having an airline where ‘dogs fly first’ makes sense.

Doggos won’t just fly stress free, they’ll be pampered on board with chicken broth dressed up in champagne bottles, treats and an in flight play area.

Now, if you’re a dog person, you’d think that this is a great idea. But, is it really a great business idea?

Well, in 2007, Pet Airways did something similar. It ran a fleet of pet-friendly domestic flights, only to accumulate financial losses and shut down four years later.

Sure, you could say that it was over a decade ago. And that the market has changed over the years. About 65 million US households own pets today, up 70% from the Pet Airways days. And about one in four customers chooses to fly with pets today. Besides, BARK Airways can also tap into its existing bunch of customers ― the 2.3 million active monthly subscribers of BarkBox, its dog treat subscription service.

Is it enough to run a profitable and sustainable business though, is something we’ll only know after BARK Airways actually takes off.

Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood🎵

Chehre by MC Square

Thanks for the intense rec Aaditaya!

A couple of things caught our eye this week 👀

Ola and Uber want to play with subscriptions

In 2022, over 70% of Ola and Uber passengers complained of ride cancellations by drivers. At least that’s what a LocalCircles survey suggests.

And a lot of folks including the Maharashtra government at one point rooted for strict penalties against such drivers. But here’s something we probably haven’t thought about enough. Why do drivers even cancel rides in the first place?

Look, Ola and Uber run on a commission based system. So every time a driver completes a ride, the ride hailing app pockets up to 30% of the fare as a commission. And if passengers choose to pay digitally, then it could take a day or a week for the earnings to clink in the driver’s bank account. It just reduces or delays their everyday earnings.

And that’s why they cancel rides at the last minute, often asking for cash payments. But this behaviour can be problematic for apps like Ola and Uber because they lose out on their commissions.

The solution?

A new subscription scheme debuting for auto drivers, where they'll just have to pay a flat daily or weekly subscription fee and take up an unlimited number of rides. It could actually increase driver earnings too, simply because they could try to accept as many rides as possible to make the most of the subscription fee they pay.

It could be a solution to frequent cancellations as well because there’s a twist. This model also means that Ola and Uber become just software connecting drivers to passengers. They don’t set prices or facilitate payments. So payments have to be directly made to the drivers via cash or UPI. It’s exactly what drivers have wanted for a long time.

But that’s not the only thing. This could also mean that these ride hailing apps save up on the 5% GST they otherwise pay on commission-based rides, because they merely operate as a SaaS (Software as a service) by offering drivers discoverability on their app. They don’t control the prices or any other aspects of supply. That’s what the GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) in Karnataka decided in the case of Namma Yatri last year, which also charges flat subscription fees to connect driver partners to passengers.`,

    title: "How a bird expanded a fundamental right",
    des: `The Supreme Court of India recently recognised a distinct fundamental right — the right against the adverse effects of climate change!

And it’s all thanks to one of India’s most critically endangered birds.

Confused?

Okay, we’ll tell you what’s going on.

See, the Great Indian Bustard (or the Godawan) is the state bird of Rajasthan. It’s an ostrich-like creature that stands at ~4 feet tall and weighs 15 kilos. So you can imagine it’s not the most agile flying species. It’s quite slow in flight and when it does fly, it keeps its eyes focused on the scrubland in the desert.

And that creates a big problem for the bird. Because it often misses the newest predator in its habitat — Power lines!

Yup, the open lands of the Kutch and Thar deserts in western India that are home to the bird are also perfect for wind and solar projects. And the transmission lines carrying power crisscross across the region.

Now the unfortunate reality of this situation is that Bustards often fly into these lines and are killed. And even 1 such death is too many because there are less than 150 of them left in the wild. And as per estimates by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), even four power line-induced deaths a year would lead to its extinction by 2040.

That doesn’t sound good, does it?

Especially since this bird is found only in our country and that too in a very concentrated habitat.

And a couple of years ago, even the Supreme Court thought so. It intervened when it realised the looming extinction threat to this majestic bird. And it asked companies involved in renewable energy projects to fix things. It wanted them to move a large segment of their transmission lines in the region underground. In other cases, it wanted them to install bird diverters. Think of these as bright circles that dangle from the power lines to create a visually clearer warning of an object.

But the companies weren’t happy. They said it would cost a mammoth $4 billion in additional expenses. And that it would hurt projects that were already awarded. All their calculations would have to be tossed in the bin and projects wouldn’t even make economic sense anymore.

Even the government was displeased.

Why, you ask?

Well, the government is banking on renewable energy in the country.

You see, Indians are using a lot more electricity than before. The per capita consumption is rising at a fast clip. But unfortunately, 70% of our electricity needs end up being fueled by coal. Now we don’t need to explain to you that coal is a dirty fossil fuel that spews a lot of harmful emissions during its use. So you can’t claim that it’s environmentally friendly. Also, another issue is that we end up importing truckloads of coal to meet our needs — we spent a gargantuan sum of nearly ₹4 lakh crores last year on imports.

So by switching away from coal, we save costs. But there’s also something else.

We have sunlight in abundance and can simply tap into this free natural resource. Some reports say there’s no other country in the G20 — which is an informal organisation of some of the top 20 economies in the world — that receives more sunlight than us. In this way, we get to fulfil the renewable energy promises we’ve made to the world while saving our valuable foreign exchange reserves too

So the government appealed to the court highlighting the importance of renewable power from the region. It called it “essential for meeting rising power demand…and…India’s international commitments on climate change”.

And that prompted the Supreme Court to evaluate the situation again.

This time, it said, “Okay, we might have gone overboard with our previous diktat. Let’s reconsider this because what we actually need is an approach which does not sacrifice either of the two at the altar of the other. We need to save the Great Indian Bustard and we need to meet our renewable energy goals. So we’ll set up a committee to decide what’s the best way forward.”

Now we don’t know what will be the outcome of that. All we can hope for is that the committee comes up with a feasible plan to meet our twin objectives — saving the bird and meeting our renewable energy goals.

But amid this tussle, the Supreme Court also realised one other thing.`,

    title: "Why is India leasing out its petroleum reserves?",
    des: `In 1973 a war broke out between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria.

And any countries siding with the Israeli military including the US, had to bear the brunt of oil sanctions. This meant that Arab members of the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), a cooperation of leading oil-producing countries, stopped exporting petroleum to them.

This coupled with oil production cuts took a toll on global oil prices which skyrocketed by as much as 130% by the end of the year.

It took a while before these sanctions could be lifted. But the disastrous after-effects of the oil shock were enough for Western Europe and the US to come together and form the IEA (International Energy Exchange). Think of it as a Western alternative to counter the dominant actions of the OPEC. They’d do it by storing strategic stocks of oil or Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPRs) which they could use during crises like these. An oil-sharing agreement would decide how they’d split this emergency reserve in times of need.

That way they wouldn’t have to be at the mercy of oil giants in the Middle East. They’d be able to stabilise oil prices or at least fend off a sudden oil price rise temporarily.

Now, there’s a reason we’re talking about SPRs.

Last week India decided that it would build its first privately managed SPR by FY30. And this arrangement is a little different from what we already have.

Our existing reserves at Mangaluru and Padur (Karnataka) and Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) are managed by the government through an entity called ISPRL (Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited). And it was the government that did all the heavy lifting in terms of building and maintaining these reserves. And although construction costs only have to be borne once, refilling crude oil in these SPRs and maintaining them can be a huge expense.

In fact, some research suggests that this cost can be so large that it could also outweigh the benefit that countries derive from releasing oil from the SPR in times of need. And that’s because SPRs only help stabilise oil prices if used at the onset of an oil supply disruption. If a government postpones releasing oil thinking that it may be too early or not the best time, oil prices could just keep rising. And SPRs may be able to do little to control the situation later.

And there’s no better example of this than the US SPR, which is the largest government-owned stockpile of petroleum in the world. To put things in perspective, it can hold 714 million barrels of oil. That’s nearly a week’s worth of global oil production.

But most oil releases from the US’ SPR haven't been significantly helpful in stabilising oil prices in times of supply crisis.

Its first major release during the US-Iraq hostilities of 1991 was very modest and came five months after global markets lost access to Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil supplies. And that meant that the release was too late to reduce oil prices or tame any economic damage that rising prices caused.

Even in 2021, oil prices had touched a seven-year peak. And this nudged the US to release 50 million barrels of crude oil from its SPR. But again, oil prices rose by $1 per barrel.

So yeah, even if you’d consider all the instances where the US has put its SPR to use, it wouldn’t really have accomplished its main objective ― stabilising the oil market.

If you consider an SPR to be an insurance policy against future oil supply or price shocks, the premium or cost of maintaining it may not be worth the actual benefits.

But that’s not the only reason. Oil supply shocks aren’t as frequent as they used to be. In any given year, there’s only a 24% chance of an oil supply shock. And some experts contend that the effects may not be as bad. Even amidst a huge disruption like the Russia-Ukraine war, traders in Dubai and Singapore have rejigged their routes and sent huge quantities of discounted oil through Indian refiners. It simply means that the world has become better equipped to adapt to disruptions. We’re also trying to move away from petroleum-based energy, in a bid to curb emissions and embrace renewable sources of energy. `,

    title: `Trump trial: Dozens of jurors rejected as they say they cannot be impartial`,
    des: `Mr Trump denies falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.

Sixty of 96 potential jurors were quick to say in the New York court that they could not be impartial.

Those left were then asked multiple questions, including about their news and book reading habits.

"I just couldn't do it," one prospective juror was heard saying as she left court on Monday.

The dismissals were an indication of how challenging it could be to find a group of 12 impartial jurors for a case concerned with a high-profile sex scandal involving a former president running once again for the White House.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office alleges that Mr Trump directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to pay Ms Daniels $130,000 (£104,000) in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter that the former president denies took place.

Prosecutors say he did so to "unlawfully influence" the 2016 election. Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty.

Jury selection began in the afternoon. The judge started by dismissing jurors who raised their hand to say they could not be impartial, leaving around 34 people.

Those left were then grilled on 42 questions in the jury questionnaire, including on their news-reading habits, whether they had attended any Trump rallies or read any of the former president's books.

Eighteen were placed at random in the jury box, and they answered the questionnaire one by one.

One man from Midtown Manhattan said that he read the Wall Street Journal. Another from the Upper West Side said his radio habits included listening to whatever was on when he was in the shower. He later clarified he meant NPR.

Neither was dismissed immediately.

A woman was asked: "Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former president Donald Trump, or the fact that he is a current candidate for president, that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?"

She simply replied "yes" and was dismissed, although Mr Trump's team initially objected to excusing her for reasons they did not explain.

All jurors will remain anonymous due to the high-profile nature of the case, although Mr Trump's legal team and prosecutors will know their identities.

Quiet in the court
The accused stayed quiet during the day, speaking to his lawyers in a hushed tone while maintaining a stern expression. He said three words in the entirety of the morning to the judge, New York Justice Juan Merchan - all "yes", when asked about what conduct was required in court.

But outside of the court, Mr Trump said the trial was "nonsense" and an "assault on America".

Mr Trump's public remarks about the case were the subject of several minutes of debate during the morning in court.

Prosecutors argued some of Mr Trump's posts on his social media site, Truth Social, violated a gag order Justice Merchan imposed on him. The order bars Mr Trump from making public comments about people related to the case, including potential witnesses.

The order was expanded to relatives of those involved after Mr Trump attacked Justice Merchan's daughter on social media.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office asked Justice Merchan to fine Mr Trump $3,000 (£2,400) in total for three posts. That includes a post on Saturday when he called his former attorney - and future trial witness - Michael Cohen a "disgraced attorney and felon".

The judge set a hearing date of 24 April to make a decision.`,

    title: `Tramlines 2024: Hannah Rowe selected as festival headliner`,
    des: `A former contestant on talent show The Voice UK has been selected to headline Sheffield's Tramlines festival.

Hannah Rowe, from Barnsley, was chosen from 2,000 hopefuls for the Friday slot on the Library Stage at the festival as part of its Apply to Play competition.

The three-day festival, which attracts about 40,000 people per day, this year features main-stage headliners Paolo Nutini, Jamie T and Snow Patrol.

Ms Rowe said it was "crackers" to play at the event, running from 26-28 July.

Described as having a "rich, authentic, jazz-infused sound", Ms Rowe's band met at Leeds Conservatoire - a higher education music school.

The band, also featuring Sam Hughes, Luke Harrison, Owen Moriarty and Charlie Tanner, has played venues in Leeds such as The Wardrobe, Belgrave Music Hall and The Brudenell.

The group, which has been together for a year, is set to graduate on the day of the headlining slot, Ms Rowe told the BBC.

"We're going to be rocking up to graduation together, our names will be called out, we'll walk across the stage, get all of our stuff, then zoom across to Sheffield to play our first big festival together. It's crazy," she said.

Tramlines started in 2009 and has welcomed artists including the Courteeners, Kasabian, Madness, Stereophonics and Sam Fender
To be in with a chance of being selected for the paid slot, up-and-coming artists had to submit a link to their music with a panel of experts from across the music industry selecting a handful of hopefuls.

It would be a "special round-off" for the new band, Ms Rowe said.

Ms Rowe appeared on The Voice UK in 2022 and earned a place on Anne-Marie's team, but was eliminated during the call-backs part of the show.

Last year's Tramlines festival was marred by poor weather, turning the Hillsborough Park venue into a mud bath following torrential rain.

The park was partially closed for months after the event while repair work to the grass area took place. `,
